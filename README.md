# Nissan LEAF CAN bus messages

This is an evolution of the spreadsheet found at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EHa4R85BttuY4JZ-EnssH4YZddpsDVu6rUFm0P7ouwg/edit#gid=1

Proper CAN database files are also found in this repository along with the original excel spreadsheet. The .dbc files are easier to use when working with CAN messages. Please note that there are major differences between ZE0,AZEO and ZE1 LEAFs.

Please fork the repo and make changes in your repo before create a pullrequest, or message me.
